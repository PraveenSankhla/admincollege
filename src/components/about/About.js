             <p>The Aravali Journal of Technical Research (AJTR) is a peer-reviewed quarterly journal of multidisciplinary research,
                  focussing on theoretical innovations and current trends in science and technology, humanities, management,
                   law and cultural studies. Published by the Aravali Group of College, the Journal promotes original research 
                   work in all these fields and encourages an interdisciplinary approach to research. The AJTR invites original

                    books for review if these are relevant to our area of research. Please send us your articles
